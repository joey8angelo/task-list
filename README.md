# Task list
This program was inspired by an assignment to make a project with a design pattern. This task list uses strategy pattern for the undo logic, and a modification of the composite pattern for the task list.

The program has an example client for using the TaskList and Undo objects. The client in the program also handles saving the TaskList data in a csv file for usage after program closure.
